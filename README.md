ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This time, I have created a simple calendar application that displays the time and date of the day you are running this code.
I decided to go a bit harder on the presentation as when you run the code, you will see that the format is structured to what you would expect a calendar to look like.
The day's date and time are determined by the time zone you enter. 
To run the code, simply copy and paste the code into a programming software compatible with Java and run the code in a terminal!
